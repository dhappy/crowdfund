Crowdfunding
============

I am interested in creating the open source software necessary to run a restaurant: [sales](https://github.com/OneAcreCafe/sales), [costs](https://github.com/OneAcreCafe/costs), and [scheduling](https://github.com/OneAcreCafe/volunteers). I also want to rent [housing](https://github.com/dhappy/housing). The goal is a user signs up for a [tour](https://github.com/dhappy/tour) and the software helps them work out a trip schedule with accommodations and labor to pay for it.

To get all this done I need help. I'm particularly interested in the [bounty source](//bountysource.com) model. People post rewards for closing issues. I have three major issues with bountysource.com:

* Though they are [soon to support bitcoins](https://github.com/bountysource/frontend/issues/390), they will convert them to dollars.
* You can place bids on issues, but those bids aren't visible in the project view. I want totals for what it will cost to reach various milestones.
* [It doesn't work.](https://github.com/bountysource/frontend/issues/470)

So, this is an attempt to create an alternative. It will be a rails app.
