Crowdfunding
============

I want to replace the economy with a transparent computer moderated version starting with a restaurant. This software is to gather cost estimates and allow crowdfunding of the software to manage [sales](https://github.com/OneAcreCafe/sales), [costs](https://github.com/OneAcreCafe/costs), and [scheduling](https://github.com/OneAcreCafe/labor). I also want to rent [housing](https://github.com/dhappy/housing). The goal is a user signs up for a [tour](https://github.com/dhappy/tour) and the software helps them work out a trip schedule with accommodations and labor to pay for it. All the data for all the companies is completely open so systems are able to optimize as widely as possible.

To get all this done I need help. I like the [bounty source](//bountysource.com) model, but I think more could be done to encourage participation. Specifically:

1. Developers can be given claim on a bug. They then have a up until an expiration date to close the issue.
2. The ability to nest issues. For example, [Port to CouchDB](https://github.com/wholcomb/habit_tracker/issues/12) could be taken by a management/design company and they outline subtasks necessary for completion; "implement habits view", etc.
3. Programmers place bids in terms of hours to complete and an hourly rate.
4. Projects show fundraising totals in terms of bids.
5. Bitcoins supported and used as a store of value.
6. Software that accepts micropayments that go directly to programmers for unpaid work.
7. Issues are searchable topically, "ruby on rails", "javascript", etc.
8. Users can get scheduled announcements of available jobs.
